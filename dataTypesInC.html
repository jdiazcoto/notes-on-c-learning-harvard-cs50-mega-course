    <h1>Data Types and Variables for the C language</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>int</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The int data type is used for variables that will store integers
        </li>
        <li>
          Integers always take up 4 bytes of memory(32 bits). This means the
          range of values they can store is necessarily limited to 32 bits worth
          of info
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>unisgned int</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          unisgned is a qualifier that can be applied to certain types
          (including int), which effectively doubles the positive range of
          variables of that ype, at the cost of disallowing any negative values
        </li>
        <li>You'll occasionally have use for unisgned variables</li>
      </ul>
      <li>char</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The char data type is used for variables that will store single
          characters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Characters always take up 1 byte of memory(8 bits). This means the
          range of values they can store is necessarily limited to 8 bits worth
          of information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Thanks to ASCII,we've developed a mapping of characters like A,B,C,
          etc... to numeric values in the positiveside of this range
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>float</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The float data type is used for variables that will store
          floating-point values, also known as real numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Floating points values always take up 4 bytes of memory (32 bits)
        </li>
        <li>
          It's a little complicated to describe the range of a float but suffice
          it to say with 32 bits of precision some of which might be use for an
          integer part, we are limited in how precise we can be
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>double</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The double data type is used for variables that will store
          floating-point values, also known as real numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
          The difference is that doubles are double precision. They always take
          up 8 bytes of memory(64 bits)
        </li>
        <li>
          WIth an additional 32 bits of precision relative to a float, doubles
          allow us to specify much more precise real numbers
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>void</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Is a type, but not a data type.</li>
        <li>
          Functions cn have a void return type, which just means they don't
          return a value
        </li>
        <li>
          The parameter list of function can also be void. It simply means the
          function takes no parameters.
        </li>
        <li>
          For now, think of void more as a placeholder for "nothing". It's more
          complex than that, but for now that is alright.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
